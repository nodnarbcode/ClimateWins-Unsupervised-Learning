# ClimateWins-Supervised-Learning

## Project Summary
ClimateWins is interested in more-practical applications of machine learning–for instance, if machine learning can be used to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.
ClimateWins wants to assess what tools are available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. It’s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the past 10 to 20 years.
 However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.
 
## Key Goals
1. Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years.
2. Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe
3. Determining whether unusual weather patterns are increasing
4. Generating possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based on current trends.
5. Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years

## Data
The dataset used for this project is based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist for almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more. This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.

## Tools
1. Powerpoint
2. Python
